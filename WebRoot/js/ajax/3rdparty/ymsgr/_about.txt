/*

This module contains the required core of the Messenger SDK, needed as soon
as the application wants to login, establish presence, and generate a
buddy list.

It is intended to be a minimal set of functionality for applications to load
when starting up IM presence.  As much as possible, code related to actual
conversations has been moved out to another module, y_msgr_ext.

The file z_ymsgr.js is Candygram-specific.  It is intended for this to move
into a Candygram module eventually.  The other files are application-agnostic,
should be considered owned by the Messenger team, and should not call out
to or contain any CG-specific code.
