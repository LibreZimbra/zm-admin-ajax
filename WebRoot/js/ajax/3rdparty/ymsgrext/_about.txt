/*

This module contains extensions to the Messenger SDK for managing chat sessions.

It has event and session managers to manage conversations.  It has send utilities 
for sending messages and other events that generally only occur in conversations.
(The main SDK does contain some send functionality as well, ones needed for user
presence and other non-conversation operations.)

There are also some utils for converting HTML to YML and back, and for verifying SMS
phone numbers.

This code is to be considered owned by the Messenger team.  DO NOT make Candygram-specific
additions to these files, and DO NOT call any Candygram code from here.  Note that the
entire directory is not munged.

The file z_ymsgr_ext.js follows Candygram naming conventions, but does not contain CG
code.
